 <p>3.It uses requests resource Inlining for use getting multiple pages.</p> 
 <p>4.It compresses data by itself.</p> 



 <h2>HTTP2:</h2>

<h1>OBJECT & INTERNAL REPRESENTATION:</h1>

<h2>OBJECT:</h2>
<p>Objects are important data types in javascript. Objects are different than primitive datatypes (i.e. number, string, boolean, etc.).
 Primitive data types contain one value but Objects can hold many values in form of Key: value pair. These keys can be variables or 
 functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.</p>

 <h2>INTERNAL REPRESENTATION:</h2>
 <p>Every object has some property associated with some value. These values can be accessed using these properties associated with them.</p>
